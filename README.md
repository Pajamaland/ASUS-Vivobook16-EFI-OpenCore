# ASUS Vivobook 16 M1605Y (Ryzen 7 7730U) - OpenCore EFI - macOS 13 Ventura
### HEAVY WORK IN PROGRESS  

## Issues
- Sleep will not work, *ever*. This is due to the fact that the laptop doesn't support S3, only S0ix.  You can bypass this by just using hibernation. On an SSD, the wake time isn't too bad.  
- Hardware acceleration for Chromium-based applications & Firefox not working (will crash immediately).  
- Can't use Fn lock.  
  
Everything else works fine as far as I can tell.
